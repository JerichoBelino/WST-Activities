    <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Jericho V. Belino</strong>, but you can call me <b>Echo</b> for short.</p>
    <p>
      I'm from Tadlac, Alitagtag, Batangas and I'm 20 years old.  
      My birthday is <u>July 15, 2005</u>,  
      and I am an Information Technology student
      <p>at <i>Batangas State University - TNEU Lipa Campus</i></p>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      My mother's name is <del>Sherlyn Belino</del>, and my father's name is <del>Edgardo Belino</del>.  
      I have two sisters and their names are <mark>Carlene Belino</mark> and <mark>Corazon Belino</mark>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My hobbies include playing online games, a little bit of coding and I enjoy eating foods.  
      Most of the time, I am spending my time with my cousins.
    </p>  
    <p>My dream is to become a <strong>Web Developer</strong>.</p>

    <p><i>"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 
        It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, 
    </p>
    <p>it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs."</i>. - 1 Corinthians 13:4–5</p>
